## ATM Program
This program simulates a basic ATM system using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the system to perform essential banking operations. The program is built around the ATM class, which encapsulates data and methods for secure and efficient handling of user transactions.

## Key Features:
Create PIN: Users can set up a new PIN and an initial account balance.
Change PIN: Allows users to update their PIN after verifying the old PIN.
Check Balance: Displays the account balance after verifying the PIN.
Withdraw Money: Enables users to withdraw funds if they have sufficient balance.
Secure Access: All sensitive operations require PIN verification, ensuring data security.
## OOP Principles Used:
Encapsulation: Sensitive data such as the user's PIN and balance are protected and accessible only through class methods.
Reusability: The program's modular structure allows methods to be reused and called from the menu.
## Application:
This program is a foundational example of an ATM system. While it is simplistic and console-based, it demonstrates the core concepts of OOP and can be further extended to include more advanced features such as deposit functionality, error logging, or integration with a database.
